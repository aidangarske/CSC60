## Midtern Review

main(int argc char * argv[])

open call open() get back a file descriptor whcih is a number 
to a file theres already stderr stout stdin there with file 
descriptor to look in table 

why have so many makefiles? - need to split into dif dir where the fit
job of project make - it jsut sets up and then kicks of the lower makefiles

stint 1 
stderr 2 
2>&1 

| connects stdout -> stdin
find command 

script is interpreted and excutable is binary and got commpiled 

true any non zero I guess
false 0 

if we want to see if bit is set put 1 in mask if set and 
and and if 1 then its set

xor can toggle the bits to change them

system vs library functions system
